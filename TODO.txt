* Finish redesign (already started before)
* Add categories (Places, Walks, Stories, Facts)
  - Front page per category /ru/places/ etc.
* Add tags (various)
  - Tags list page /ru/tags/cities/ etc.
* Add coordinates to all existing pages
* Add maps to front page, to categories pages
* Redesign top menu
* Update About pages
* Add link to Finnish version (and make it default?)
* Add maps to front page, category pages for places and walks
* Add new few places posts
* Create Facebook page


Remaining features
------------------

* Places index
* POIs with multiple points
* POIs with polylines?
* Probably POIs display improvement (sidebar etc.)

Optimization (when needed)
--------------------------

* Basic optimization could probably be saving the project state (with all preloaded content etc.)
  into a JSON file and reloading it on startup (and checking that existing files are not newer than this JSON)

Other points
------------

* Should the generator be a separate project?  Will bring a lot of complexity.  Code cleanup, tests
  will be necessary
